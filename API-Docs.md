# ChronosenX API documentation

> # **⚠️ Warning:** **We** are not responcable for anything that can happen when using chronos (such as bans), **you** claim **all** responsibility for your actions when using chronos and its APIs!

## First, we have to initinlise ChronosenX:

We have to do this so that Visual Studio 2022 will recognise and give no errors.

At the top of your project you will see code that says "using ---;"

Here at the bottom of your "using" list write ```using chronosenx;```

After that we should be all ready to start using Chronos's API!

-------------------------------

## Next, we will start if with attaching:

on your designer add a button of your choise (Chronos using a libary called Guna), after you have done this click the button twise and it should take you to the code with a new snippet for the button
in here you will write ```chronosen.attach(); ```
